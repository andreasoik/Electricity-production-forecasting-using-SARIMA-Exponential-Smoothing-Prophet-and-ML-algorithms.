# Electricity-production-forecasting-using-SARIMA-Exponential-Smoothing-Prophet-and-ML-algorithms.
The main goal of this project is to utilize SARIMA models, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet (Facebook's library), and machine learning algorithms to forecast electricity production. The implementation of these techniques is carried out using Python. Various well-known libraries have been included in the project, making it turnkey. It should be noted that for the application of machine learning methods, the skforecast library is used, creating fixed windows as training data and fine-tuning the hyperparameters using representative grid search.
